    "Lately there has been a tremendous increase in the number of people travelling and exploring new places across the globe. People visiting new places would love to get recommendations about things to do, about places to see and about places to dine in. This has resulted in the increased popularity of several recommendation websites and apps like Yelp that provide recommendations to people. \n",

    "Being able to recommend restaurants for people to dine in when they are travelling or visiting a new place is a very valuable feature as far as the recommendation system goes. In this document the we will try and build a model that would recommend restaurants to users in the neighborhoods of New York based on what is popular in a certain place based on ratings and reviews provided by other people and also based on the user's past preferences in terms of the cuisines that they prefer to eat.\n",
